# CS2 Skin Investment Advisor üìà
A full-stack application that leverages machine learning and real-time market data to provide investment advice for the Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) skin market. This tool helps users track their portfolio, analyze market trends, and make data-driven decisions to maximize their return on investment.

# Core Features
üìä Market Data Collection: Scrapes and aggregates data from the Steam Community Market and third-party sites like CSFloat and Buff163, tracking price history, volume, and item metadata.

ü§ñ Price Prediction Engine: Utilizes Random Forest/XGBoost and LSTM models with technical and fundamental analysis to forecast future skin prices.

üí° Investment Recommendation System: Generates "Buy/Hold/Sell" signals using portfolio optimization techniques (Modern Portfolio Theory) and custom risk scoring.

üíº Portfolio Tracker & Analytics: Allows users to import their Steam inventory to monitor real-time Profit & Loss, analyze portfolio health, and set up custom price alerts.

# Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Chart.js / D3.js

Backend: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Redis

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, XGBoost

APIs & Scraping: Steam API, aiohttp, BeautifulSoup

Deployment: Docker, AWS / Heroku

# Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js and npm

Docker and Docker Compose

A Steam API Key (get one here)

# Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs2-skin-investment-advisor.git
cd cs2-skin-investment-advisor
```
2. Backend Setup
* Create a virtual environment:
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
* Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your Steam API key:
```
STEAM_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost/cs2_db"
```
* Launch the database with Docker:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start a PostgreSQL container.
* Run the backend server:
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
```
3. Frontend Setup
* Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
* Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.

4. Run Initial Data Collection
* Execute the collection script to populate the database with initial skin data.
```
python scripts/collect_data.py
```

# Implementation Roadmap

The project is being developed in three main phases:

Phase 1 (Complete): Data Foundation & Basic UI

‚úÖ Data collection pipeline for popular skins from the Steam Market.

‚úÖ PostgreSQL database schema for items and price history.

‚úÖ Basic web interface to browse skins and view historical price charts.

Phase 2 (In Progress): ML Predictions & Portfolio Tracking

‚è≥ Implementation of ML prediction models (Random Forest, LSTM).

‚è≥ User portfolio tracking by importing a Steam inventory.

‚è≥ Development of an initial investment scoring algorithm.

Phase 3 (Upcoming): Recommendation Engine & Advanced Analytics

planned: Build a full recommendation engine with "Buy/Hold/Sell" signals.

planned: Implement a notification system for price alerts.

planned: Polish UI/UX and add advanced portfolio analytics dashboards.
