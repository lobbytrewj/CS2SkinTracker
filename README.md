# Core Features
üìä Market Data CollectionScrapes and aggregates data from the Steam Community Market and third-party sites like Buff163 to track price history, volume, and item metadata.

ü§ñ Price Prediction Engine: Utilizes Random Forest/XGBoost and LSTM models with technical and fundamental analysis to forecast future skin prices.

üí° Investment Recommendation System: Generates "Buy/Hold/Sell" signals using portfolio optimization techniques (Modern Portfolio Theory) and custom risk scoring.

üíº Portfolio Tracker & Analytics: Allows users to import their Steam inventory to monitor real-time Profit & Loss, analyze portfolio health, and set up custom price alerts.

# Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Chart.js / D3.js

Backend: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, XGBoost

APIs & Scraping: Buff163 API, aiohttp, BeautifulSoup

Deployment: Local System (AWS coming soon)
